# Pipeline-Processor
Pipelined Processor with Caching 

Project for Computer Protoyping Lab (ECE 437)
Partned with Aaron Kaiser

Most RTL designs contributions are in the source, interface, and test bench folders

A five stage pipelined processor (instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write back)
Two different cache type (instruction cache, data cache)
Tested using different assembly routines (merge sort, multiple, branching)
